Revision history for Perl module Module::Loader

0.01 2014-10-05 NEILB
    - Plugin::Loader renamed to Module::Loader. Writing the doc and then
      starting a blog post about it make me realise that Module::Loader
      would be a much more appropriate name. Thanks to BRADH for giving
      me the Module::Loader name.
    - Tests were failing on win32. Needed to change
            use lib 't/lib';
      To a more OS-portable version. It was adding the directory ok, but
      the regexp to strip the head of the path wasn't working.
